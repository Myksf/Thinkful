1. Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.
A. Each coin flip is indpendent of the prior coin flip, therefore each coin flip can be calculated as P(Heads) = 1/2 or P(Tails) = 1/2
   The probability of independtens events happening can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event with one 
   another. Therefore: P(HTTH) = .5 * .5 * .5 * .5 = .0625, P(HHHH) = .5 * .5 * .5 * .5 = .0625, P(TTHH) = .5 * .5 * .5 * .5 = .0625
   
2. If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45. What is the probability 
   of not choosing a man?
A. The probability of choosing a woman is the same as not choosing a man, therefore, 24/45.

3. The probability that Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year is 10%. The probability of a plane crash at any time is 
   .005%. What is the probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash sometime in the next year?
A. The probability of the event happening is .0005% which is the product of traveling by plane (10%) and the probability of a plane crash
   (.005%).
4. A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website. Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there
   is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the 
   survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is
   wrong with this conclusion?
A. The odds will change for users who spend more time surfing the company website

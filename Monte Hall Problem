Monte Hall Problem

Three doors, one door had the prize, the other two doors had a zonk.

You pick one, and then Monte would open one of the other doors reveal a zonk. Then he would ask if you wanted to switch.

Stick or switch?

Switch everytime. 
Where x is door pwith prize, and y is a zonk

P(x & y) = P (x|y) P (y)
Is equal to
P(y & x) = P (y|x) P (x)
So,
P(x|y) P(y) = P(y|x) P(x)
divid by P(y)
P(x|y) = (P(y|x)P(x))/P(y)

P(x|y) = P(1/2)P(1/3)/P(1/3)

There is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind the initial door picked, and 2/3 behind the door you didn't pick, minus the reveal. It is
not a guarentee that you will win, but over time, switching is a better strategy over the long term.

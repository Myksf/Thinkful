Bayes' Rule:
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

OR

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / [P(A)*P(B|A) + P(A~)*P(B|A~)]

A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 
10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers.
Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

1. Be positive
A. If 1,000,000 people were tested and the given possibility of suffering from Thripshaw's Disease is .5%, then potentially 5,000 would
   test postive. (.98 * .005) + (.10 * .995) = .1044 or 10.44%

2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
A. diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease

3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
A. If there is a 10% probablity of a false postitive, then correctly identifing a non-sufferer would be 90%.

4. Misclassify the person
A. P(Infected| Positive Test) = P(Positive Test| Infected) * P(Infected) / P(Positive Test)
   False Postitive + False Negative = 0.0996 = 9.96%
   False Positive = (1-.005) * .10 = 0.0995
   False Negative = .005 * .02 = 0.0001
